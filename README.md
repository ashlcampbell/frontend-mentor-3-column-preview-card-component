## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned

This was my first Frontend Mentor challenge, and I had a lot of fun completing it. I'm very excited about finding this site and building my frontend knowledge!

I have basic HTML and CSS knowledge and was able to complete the majority of the project without referring to resources. The areas that were the biggest challenge for me were: 
- Removing the whitespace between the card divs. I found [an article](https://css-tricks.com/fighting-the-space-between-inline-block-elements/) on css-tricks with various ways to tackle this, and I opted for the negative margin technique. 

- Changing the CSS for mobile view - specifically making sure the corners were rounded in the right places when the cards are stacked on top of each other. I used W3Schools for a mini primer on media queries for this. 

### Continued development

I'm curently working through Angela Yu's The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/lecture/13306918#overview). I will need to supplement this because it does not cover Flexbox or Grid, which I expect I will need for future challenges. 

I'm also planning to work through FreeCodeCamp's [Response Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/) tutorials.
